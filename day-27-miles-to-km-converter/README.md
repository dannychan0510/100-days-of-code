# Day 27: Miles to Km Converter

This simple Tkinter application converts miles to kilometers using a graphical user interface (GUI).

## üêç Python Concepts Learned

During the development of this application, I learned and familiarised myself with the basic concepts of using the
Tkinter package to build a simple app with a GUI interface. The following Python concepts and Tkinter features were
learned:

1. Importing the Tkinter module and creating a main application window.
2. Configuring the main window's properties, such as its title and size.
3. Creating and configuring various Tkinter widgets, such as Entry, Label, and Button.
4. Using geometry managers like `grid()` to position and manage the layout of the widgets within the main window.
5. Defining and using a function to respond to a user interaction, such as clicking a button.
6. Starting the main event loop with `window.mainloop()` to handle user interactions and keep the GUI responsive.

## üöÄ How to Run the Program

To run the Miles to Km Converter application, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. This program is compatible with Python 3.6 or higher.
2. Save the code above in a file named `miles_to_km_converter.py`.
3. Run the program with `python miles_to_km_converter.py` (or
   `python3 miles_to_km_converter.py` on some systems). Make sure you use the `cd` command to change the working
   directory to where you saved the program.
