# Day 28: Pomodoro Timer

This Python project is a simple Pomodoro Timer application that uses the Tkinter library for its graphical user interface. The Pomodoro Timer helps users to manage their work and break intervals by following the Pomodoro Technique. It consists of 25-minute work intervals (called "Pomodoros") followed by short (5-minute) and long (20-minute) breaks.

## üêç Python Concepts Learned

### Tkinter

Through building this Pomodoro Timer application, I gained a better understanding of the Tkinter library, a popular library for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. Some of the key concepts covered include:

- Creating and configuring the main application window.
- Using various Tkinter widgets, such as `Label`, `Canvas`, and `Button`.
- Arranging widgets using the `grid` geometry manager.
- Handling button clicks with command functions.
- Implementing a timer using the `after` method.

### Dynamic Typing

Another important Python concept I utilized in this project is dynamic typing. It was used to generate the timer text by converting integers to strings and concatenating them as needed. This allowed for easy manipulation and formatting of the timer text displayed on the screen.

## üöÄ Running the Program

To run the Pomodoro Timer program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Download the `pomodoro_timer.py` file, and if necessary, the `tomato.png` image file (if the application uses an image for the timer background).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt, and navigate to the directory containing the `pomodoro_timer.py` file.

4. Run the following command to start the Pomodoro Timer application:

```bash
python3 pomodoro_timer.py
```
