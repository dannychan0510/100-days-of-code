<h1>My Favourite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>In no particular order</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Martian</h3>
<p>
  Amazing sci-fic movie, so positive. Full of hope and positivity, and
  demonstrates the resilience of the human spirit. Also love the "Love Train"
  song choice at the end of the movie!
</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>
  Masterpiece. Enough said. Also, please do yourselves a favour and watch the
  Extended Editions!
</p>
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>
  So much greed and debauchery. Which is also what makes it infitely
  rewatchable!
</p>
<h3>Denis Villeneuve's Dune</h3>
<p>Arguably an instant masterpiece, one for the ages. Denis is a genius.</p>
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>
  The movie that put Shinkai Makoto's name on the global radar. Arguably his
  best movie (as of 2023, IMO).
</p>
<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>Also known as "The Shape of Sound". Personally this touched me alot.</p>
